# Image Classification with PyTorch

This project implements an image classification model using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The model is built using **PyTorch**, and the goal is to classify images into 10 different categories such as airplanes, cars, dogs, etc.

## Features:
- Built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.
- Trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** (with 60,000 images in 10 classes).
- Achieves a classification accuracy of **62%** on the test set.
- Code is modular and easily adaptable to other image classification tasks.
