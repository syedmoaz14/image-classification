# Image Classification with PyTorch

This project implements an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is built using PyTorch, and the goal is to classify images into 10 different categories such as airplanes, cars, and dogs.

## Features:
- Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- Trained on CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Achieves a classification accuracy of **62%** on the test set.

## Setup:
